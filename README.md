# Global-Internet-Usage-in-the-Year-2020
This analysis aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the geographical distribution of key  internet usage metrics. These include the percentage of internet users, the total number of  internet users, mobile subscriptions, and fixed broadband subscriptions. The goal is to identify trends in relation to these data variables, particularly internet usage, and visualize them on a map. 
The analysis is based on data from 2020, providing insights into the most recent global trends in 
internet usage.

Data Cleaning and Calculations
In preparing the data for analysis, several steps were taken to ensure accuracy and consistency: 
• Spelling Error Check: Spelling errors in the entity column were thoroughly checked and corrected. 
• Duplicate Check: The data was reviewed for duplicates, but none were found. 
• Formatting: The percentage symbol (%) was added to the “internet users” column for 
proper formatting. 

• DAX Calculations: 
o The average percentage of internet users was calculated to determine the global penetration of the internet in 2020. 
o The average number of cellular subscriptions per 100 people was computed. 
o The average number of broadband subscriptions per 100 people was also calculated to assess the reach of broadband internet. 

Key Metrics; 
The key metrics derived from the analysis are as follows: 
• The average percentage of internet users globally was found to be 17.04%. 
• The average number of cellular subscriptions per 100 people was 40 subscriptions. 
• The average number of broadband subscriptions per 100 people stood at 4 broadband subscriptions per 100 people. 

Insights and Observations 
1. Growth in Internet Users (1980 to 2020): The analysis reveals a steady increase in the number of internet users from 1980 to 2020, with a significant surge in 2020. This suggests that internet penetration is growing worldwide, and a predictive analysis indicates that this trend will likely continue in the coming years, with the number of users expected to increase year over year. 
2. Average Percentage of Internet Users by Region: A regional breakdown of internet usage revealed that European countries dominate the top ranks for internet penetration. Liechtenstein and Montenegro topped the list, with internet user percentages of 55.8% and 50.8%, respectively—both significantly higher than the global average of 17.4%. This indicates that internet access is more widespread in these regions compared to others. 
3. Cellular Subscriptions Over Time and by Region: Cellular subscriptions, a vital service for mobile internet access, have shown steady growth across all regions. The analysis highlights the regions with the highest number of cellular subscriptions and demonstrates the global nature of mobile connectivity. It is clear that mobile internet access is a key driver of global connectivity. 
4. Broadband Subscription Trends (Fixed and Mobile): Broadband subscriptions, which provide high-speed internet access, have also seen significant growth. This analysis focuses on fixed broadband subscriptions, which provide downstream speeds greater than 256 kbit/s. Over time, the number of broadband subscriptions per 100 people has increased steadily. Monaco emerged as the top region in terms of broadband subscription penetration, highlighting the prominence of high-speed internet access in developed areas.
   
Recommendations;
• Increase Investment in Infrastructure: To support the growing demand for internet access, there should be continued investment in broadband infrastructure, especially in 
regions with lower penetration rates. 
• Focus on Mobile Connectivity: Since cellular subscriptions are widespread and growing rapidly, policymakers should focus on enhancing mobile internet access to bridge the 
digital divide, particularly in rural and underserved areas. 
• Targeted Initiatives for Emerging Regions: While certain regions show impressive internet penetration, others, particularly in Africa and parts of Asia, lag behind. 
Governments and organizations should implement targeted programs to boost internet usage in these regions. 
• Promote High-Speed Internet Access: As broadband subscriptions continue to rise, efforts should be made to ensure that the quality of service (speed, stability, and 
accessibility) meets the needs of users. Public-private partnerships could be a valuable tool in achieving this goal. 

In conclusion, this analysis offers valuable insights into global internet usage trends, highlighting key growth areas and regions with significant disparities in internet access. The findings suggest that while progress has been made, continued efforts are necessary to ensure more equitable 
access to the internet globally.
